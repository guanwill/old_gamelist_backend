# My Games List Rails Backend

* Two models: User and Games. User has many games.  
* Token based Authentication API Endpoints set up using [Devise Token Auth Gem](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth)
* Restful API also set up for Games, but must be authenticated first
* Basically a boilerplate template for basic authentication and model. For future purposes.
